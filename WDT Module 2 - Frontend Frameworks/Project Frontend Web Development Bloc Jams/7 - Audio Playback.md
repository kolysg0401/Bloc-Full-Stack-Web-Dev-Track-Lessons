**E1: An alternative approach to state management is to use a portable state container like Redux. Read the Motivation section of Redux's documentation. In your checkpoint submission, explain the pros and cons of Redux.**

> R1:

| Pros        | Cons         |
| ------------- |-------------:|
| Brings Predictability      | Unwieldy in large applications |
| Enforces Unidirectional Data Flow      | Lots of typing required      |
| Separation of Data and Presentation | Lots of boilerplate      |
| Enforces Immutability | Actions are disconnected from their effect(reducer)  |

Like a lot of tools right now Redux is providing a necessary function but a Google shows plenty of people have plenty of suggestions to make about how it could be better. Most people agree it's relatively simple though it does have some usual syntax and as the Motivations page points out it is trying address difficult concepts for human to concretize so it does have a learning curve for it's more advanced elements and it's use in large projects can be cumbersome due to the large about of boilerplate code that has to be added in over and over for every input element. It does reinforce a lot of React concepts so it's no surprise they play well together which is another big pro given the popularity of React and that way of thinking.

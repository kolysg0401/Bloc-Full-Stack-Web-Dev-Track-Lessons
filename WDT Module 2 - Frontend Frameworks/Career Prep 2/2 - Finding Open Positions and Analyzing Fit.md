<p style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold">WDT Module 2 - Frontend Frameworks<br>Career Prep 2<br>Checkpoint 2 - Finding Open Positions and Analyzing Fit</p>

***Exercises***
**E1:Research and find 3 job postings that you believe you fit into well. Analyze each job posting with the "What, Where, When, How, Day-to-Day" questions covered in the checkpoint.**

**E2: Research and follow 3 companies local to you (on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook). Share the companies that you chose to follow, and share your research findings on them too.
	--Attempt to reach out to at least one person per company that you researched and initiate a conversation/chat with the. Try connecting with them on LinkedIn and always include a personalized note describing why you want to connect. The goal here is to hop on a call or grab coffee with a team member of that company, to learn more about what it's like day to day job as a developer there. You're trying to get the "insider's perspective"!
	--If you get any results from this connection attempt/outreach, share your findings here! No worries if they don't connect back, however - this is just the beginning!**

**E3: Make a copy of this Google Doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qR4tU-6cLuGRf5H88l0PUksNZ-jJ7FyC-4wDWEWQ__M/copy and share the accessible link in this submission.**

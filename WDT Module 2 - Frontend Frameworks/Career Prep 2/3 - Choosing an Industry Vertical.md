***Exercises***
**Copy this Google document so that you have your own version to work in.**

**Add 30 jobs to the list that you think are exciting and are in the location you’re looking for jobs.**

**Once you’ve added the 30 jobs to your list, look at the “results” tab and see what industry has the highest score. Does this industry make sense? Why or why not?**

**At your next scheduled mentor meeting, talk to your mentor about incorporating these industry verticals and technologies into your projects throughout the Bloc curriculum.**

**Share your spreadsheet with the Career Services Team via this checkpoint submission (remember to set the share settings to "Anyone with a link can view"). In your submission, include your top 2 industry verticals and what you think about working in these fields. Were you surprised by your results?**

This was a worthwhile exercise to help me focus my efforts on particular types of industries as well as seeing what in demand skills I need to acquire

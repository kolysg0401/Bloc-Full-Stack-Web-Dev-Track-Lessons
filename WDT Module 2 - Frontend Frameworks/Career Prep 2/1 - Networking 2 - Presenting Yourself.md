"I'm Koop. I make cool things for cool people. (Pause for invitation to continue if interested). I make electrons dance to solve their problems and make their lives easier and more enjoyable. I program solutions for their businesses, their personal lives, and sometimes just for fun, theirs AND mine. Right now I'm learning to do all that with JavaScript and I would love the chance to pick your brain sometime about how you use, or maybe could use, JavaScript to make what you want and need for your business and for your life. Can I send you a connection request on LinkedIn?"

LinkedIn Summary: Former HP Data Analyst starting second career as JacaScript developer. I live to solve problems and learn new things.

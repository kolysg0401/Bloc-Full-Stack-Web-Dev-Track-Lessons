## Project - Intro to React
### Checkpoint 1 - Why React?
#### Exercises

**E1: In your own words, explain single-page applications and progressive web apps.**
> Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are apps that, instead of having multiple pages  like most sites or apps, SPAs load a single page and update elements that one page as the user interacts with the app using AJAX and HTML5 to create dynamic and responsive apps without constant page reloads with a lot of the work happening on the client side in JavaScript.

**E2: Either from your research or by inspecting popular sites you frequent (using the Chrome DevTools), give some real-world examples of applications built with React and Angular.**

> | Angular | React   |
> | :------- |--------:|
> | PayPal| Facebook |
> | Intel| eBay |
> | Google| Netflix |

**E3: Write a summary of the benefits of React vs. Angular. Then ask your mentor about the current state of web development, and ask questions about how they use these two popular technologies in their work.**

> React vs. Angular 2
> | Pros | Cons  |
> | :------- |--------:|
> | JS not TS| Requires Flux/Redux |
> | Virtual DOM | Needs bundlers |
> | Easy setup| No HTML, just JSX |
> | Bigger community  | Requires more code  |
> | Easier Debugging  |   |

> My mentor Shannon remembers how revolutionary Angular was when it first came out, but just doesn't care for TypeScript saying it she doesn't mind strongly typed languages in general but when applied to javaScript or in place of javaScript she says it just feels forced and takes a lot of the fun out of writing JS. She thinks Angular 2 did a lot to improve it's performance so it's now on par with React but something about React just seems "freer" and more simple.  Which to use will have a lot to do with the team I am on, if any, and specific requirements of the project but with all other variables being equal she prefers React.  I look forward to trying them both, plus a few others!

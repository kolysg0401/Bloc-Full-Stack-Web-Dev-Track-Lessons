For this assignment, read about the concept of [release early, release often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) and write at least one reason for and one against this practice in the submission box

RERO provides a rapid feedback loop. The shorter the feedback loop, the faster value is added. "Try driving while only looking at the road every 10 secs, vs. constantly". RERO gets features and bug fixes in customers hands faster. The faster the cycle, the shorter the time you and your users have to live with a known bug. Having completed work that isnâ€™t released is not only wasteful but can cause you to forget the original reason for the feature and as feedback on the feature comes in it takes time to re-acquaint yourself with the code and the reasons the code was written the way it was. It also keeps developers and users engaged by the sight of constant (even daily) improvement in their work/user experience.

RERO does have some drawbacks in some situations.  It forces end users to update their software more often. In the cases of something like a browser this can be relatively painless, but in cases like a web framework there is a much higher adoption cost and steeper learning curve, and folks running sites on these framework versions want time to upgrade to the next version without having that version become obsolete immediately. Another concern raised is that RERO leads to more frequent lower quality releases rather than less frequent releases with higher polish and quality.

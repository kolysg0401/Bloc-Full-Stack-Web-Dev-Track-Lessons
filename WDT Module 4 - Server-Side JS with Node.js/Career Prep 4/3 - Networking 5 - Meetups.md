# Networking Goals
1. 3-5 Contacts per event attended.  At this point I need as many contacts as I can get so I am going to focus on events that can support this level of new contacts per event.  Luckily where I live this seems an attainable level of results
2. Non-coding Topics of Conversation. At coding sessions I will focus on code obviously, but during informal moments I want to engage people on other topics 1) to hide my lack of knowledge at this point, but more importantly 2) to make personal connections, show the diversity of my personality, and hopefully stand out from the crowd that way
3. Focus on topics and groups involving Web Development and JS. Lots and LOTS of groups in my area and I could go down the rabbit hole with groups on almost topic available but I want to focus on other JS and Web devs for now

# Code for America
I joined the San Jose Brigade and will be atending their Nov. 28th coding session. I will be working on the [Heart of the Valley Project](https://www.codeforsanjose.com/heartofthevalley/)

## Checkpoint 5 - Thinking and Talking About Salary

**Use Salary.com and Glassdoor.com to find out the market rates for developers in your preferred job locations or top companies. Were you surprised by what you learned? Was the range higher or lower than what you expected? Tell us in your submission for this checkpoint.**

> I was surprised at the diference between the Glassdoor and the Salary.com data points. Glassdoor indicates an average starting salary for entry level junior web developers in my area at ~$101K a year.  That's based on 407 submissions but seems high.  Salary.com (you guys weren't kidding about their bad interface!) shows a Web Applications Developer salary in my area at ~$73 a year which sounds a little low but more like what I have gathered from other sources. I will be shooting for something in the $80K range myself.

Record yourself answering the question “What is your preferred salary range?”

I think I may have been born to work at PayPal. Your collaborative and diverse culture is a match to my own values, and your mission’s inclusion of access to financial services as a right for all people is visionary and much needed. I am more than excited by the prospect of using my Full Stack JavaScript Development skills to help PayPal continue to disrupt the status quo and make a real difference in people’s lives.

I would be a particularly good fit for the Full Stack JavaScript Developer position, but  not only because of my experience with ES6, React, Redux, Node, SQL, data structures, algorithms, TDD, and Agile development practices. I would also be a good fit because my 15 years at HP show a demonstrated record of excellence in a collaborative, innovative, and diverse cultures like the one PayPal has cultivated, both as an individual contributor and a leader.

I find PayPal’s mission inspiring. It’s culture a requirement for success. The idea I could participate in transforming the global economy, help free people to achieve their own financial health, to make the world better off in a concrete way, is beyond exciting. But to be able to do that in a diverse and open environment where I can also grow as a developer and as a person while helping others to do the same, is quite frankly a dream.  I would be so grateful if we could speak soon.

Best Regards,

Brent “Koop” Kupras

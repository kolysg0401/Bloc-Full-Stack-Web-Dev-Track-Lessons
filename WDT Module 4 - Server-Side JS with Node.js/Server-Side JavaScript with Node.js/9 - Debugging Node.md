#### WDT Module 4 Server-side JS with Node.js
### Section 1 - Server-side JS with Node.js
## Checkpoint 9 - Debugging Node

# Exercises
## Questions

1. How do you access the DevTools for Node in Chrome?
> Open Chrome, and in the URL search bar enter: chrome://inspect. On the page that loads, click: Open dedicated DevTools for Node

2. What are the main differences between the regular Chrome DevTools and the DevTools for Node? Biggest difference is that Chrome DevTools runs in the browser and DevTools for Node runs from a command line. Chrome DevTools also has a console for running code.

3. Using the built-in Node debug tool, what command do you use to continue the execution of your code?
`cont`, or `c`, will each continue execution

4. Which statement do you put in your code to set a breakpoint?
`debugger`

## Code Challenge

There is no code challenge for this checkpoint, but you are encouraged to go to exercises in previous checkpoints in order to try using the Chrome DevTools for Node and the built-in Node debugging. These tools will come in particularly handy in the remaining 3 sections of Node. Tell us what you learned from using these handy debug tools, and discuss further use cases with your mentor in your next session.
> Using each for just a little bit it seems to me the Chrome DevTools is much easier to use with the built in console, easier to set breakpoints, easier to see what's going on. I will definitely be using the Chrome tools when I have the chance over the built in debug CLI

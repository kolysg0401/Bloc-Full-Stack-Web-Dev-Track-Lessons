Exercises

1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

Programming Questions

Before beginning to code, write out a plan explaining how to solve the question.

1. The Linked List push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Find the bug and fix the code.

LinkedList.prototype.push = function(element) {
 SET node = {
   value: element,
   next: null
 }

 IF the head node does not exist
   THEN SET head to node
 ELSE
   SET current node to head
   SET current.next to node
 }
}

2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d

3. Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

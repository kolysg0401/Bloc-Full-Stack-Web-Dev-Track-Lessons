Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

What kind of graph is a binary search tree?

Programming Questions
For the following questions, describe in words how you could solve the problem and then do so. Use the depiction of the Binary Search Tree to refer to the examples.

Given a Binary Search Tree and a value, write a function that checks to see whether the value exists within the tree.
INIT function search(node, data)
	IF node === null
		RETURN null
	ELSE IF (data < node.data)
		RETURN this.search(node.left, data)
	ELSE IF (data > node.data)
		RETURN this.search(node.right, data)
	ELSE
		RETURN node
	END IF
END FUNCTION




Example: The value 10 exists in the tree. The value 23 does not exist in the tree.

Given a Binary Search Tree and two nodes, n1 and n2, write a function that finds the distance between the two nodes.

Example: The distance between the nodes 4 and 10 is 4. The distance between the nodes 8 and 10 is 1. The distance between the nodes 1 and 14 is 4.

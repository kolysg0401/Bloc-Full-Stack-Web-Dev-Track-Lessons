6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

## **Programming Assignment:**
1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

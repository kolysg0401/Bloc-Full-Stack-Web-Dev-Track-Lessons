**Exercises**

For exercises requiring code, you are free to use the language of your choice.

1. Define and compare recursion and iteration.
> Both **Recursion** and **Iteration** allow us to repeatedly execute an instruction set, but **Recursion** does this by having a function call itself repeatedly whereas **Iteration** is when a loop executes repeatedly until the controlling conditional statement becomes false. **Recursion** is always applied to a function, but **Iteration** is applied to the set of instructions we want repeated.

2. Name five algorithms that are commonly implemented by recursion.

3. When should you use recursion, and when should you avoid recursion? Give examples for each.
4. Compare the recursive and iterative solutions to the three algorithms from the checkpoint (Factorial, Maximum, and Fibonacci). What is similar, and what is different?
5. Given a multi-dimensional collection (such as an array) where the number of dimensions is unknown, write a recursive algorithm to count the number of items in the entire collection.
6. A palindrome is a word or phrase whose spelling is the same either direction (e.g., racecar). Write a recursive algorithm to determine if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.
7. Laura and Xander are going door-to-door around their block looking for their lost cat. Write a recursive algorithm showing one way they can visit every house on their block exactly once.

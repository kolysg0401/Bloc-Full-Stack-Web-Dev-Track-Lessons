1. How does a linear search operate?
- It searches iteratively only on sorted collections.
- It uses recursion to continuously call a search function until it finds the target item.
- It iterates over each item in a collection until it finds the target item.<---correct
- None of the above.

EXPLANATION
The linear search algorithm uses a loop to iterate over each item in a collection until it finds the target item. The collection may or may not be sorted.
Covered in: Algorithms: Searching

2. How does a binary search operate?
- It uses a set of keys that are used to find the target item.
- It uses a divide and conquer approach to find the item it is searching for in a sorted list.<---correct
- It iterates through sorted or unsorted list until it finds the target item.
- None of the above.

EXPLANATION
The binary search algorithm uses a divide and conquer methodology to find what it's searching for in a collection. It only functions properly on a pre-sorted collection.

3. What best describes recursion?
- A procedure (i.e., a function) that calls itself.<---correct
- A piece of code that uses a “for” or “while” loop.
- A technique used to search data structures.
- None of the above.

EXPLANATION
Recursion is a technique in which a procedure (i.e., a function) calls itself with parameters incrementally moving toward one of the base cases.
Covered in: Recursion

4. Which of the following would be an ideal scenario in which to use recursion?
- To loop through an array to find the maximum value.
- To search for patterns in a string and perform string manipulation.
- To perform a search through a tree data structure.<---correct
- None of the above.

EXPLANATION
A search algorithm to find an item in a tree data structure would be a natural scenario in which to apply recursion. When an algorithm can be defined as a combination of sub-results starting with known cases, a recursive solution makes the most sense.
Covered in: Recursion

5. What are common tradeoffs between iterative and recursive solutions?
- Recursive solutions can often be more straightforward.
- Iterative solutions have better performance.
- Recursive solutions are more subject to system limitations.
- All of the above.<---correct

EXPLANATION
Recursive solutions tend to be cleaner and more straightforward than iterative approaches. Recursion tends to perform more slow as it depends on system resources to keep track of repeated function calls in memory.
Covered in: Recursion

6. What is needed to implement recursion?
- A for loop within the function to continue calling itself.
- A “base case” to terminate further function calls when a condition is met.<---correct
- An additional data structure to store data within the function.
- None of the above.

EXPLANATION
A recursive solution needs a minimum of two cases, a base and a recursive case. When none of the base cases are applicable, the recursive solution executes the recursive case. The recursive case is the one that calls the procedure again.
Covered in: Algorithms: Searching

7. Which of the following are algorithms commonly implemented using recursion?
- Factorial operations.
- Quicksort.
- Binary search.
- All of the above.<----correct

EXPLANATION
Recursion is used in many popular algorithms, especially searching and sorting algorithms. Some mathematical operations, such as the factorial operation and the Fibonacci sequence, are defined recursively and thus can be easily implemented as recursive functions.

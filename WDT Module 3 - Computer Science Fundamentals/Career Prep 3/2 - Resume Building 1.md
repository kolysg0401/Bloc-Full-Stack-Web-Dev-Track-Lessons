Feedback from Bloc: Submit your completed 1-page resume as a PDF with this checkpoint so that the Career Services team can review it and give you some pointers.

Feedback from friends, family of colleagues with A/B Testing: By tapping into your personal and professional networks (that includes the Bloc community on Slack!), ask at least 4 supportive people to look over your resume. Pick people with perspectives you respect, even admire, who will give you honest feedback. Give two of the people you’ve chosen one version of your resume, and give the other two the alternate version. This will allow you to potentially compare these variants against each other with a simple form of A/B Testing.

Here are some questions that might be helpful to ask the people reading your resume:

Is everything as clear as possible? Is anything confusing?
What do you feel this resume says about me as a professional?
What’s working? What needs improvement? What would make this resume stronger?
Since these variants of your resume use the same template and the only difference is the content, you won’t have to worry about different formatting. Yes, formatting is important in making your resume attractive, even unique, but we’ll get to that later.

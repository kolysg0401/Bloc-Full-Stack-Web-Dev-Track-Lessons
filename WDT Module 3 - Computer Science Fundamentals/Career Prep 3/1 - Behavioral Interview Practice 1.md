Hi!

Thanks so much for your interest in our Front-End Developer position at Vend.ly. We reviewed your resume and think that you might be a good fit for our team. Weâ€™d like to schedule an initial phone screen with you. Can you let me know a few times when you are available next week and the best number to reach you at?

I look forward to speaking with you.

Greetings, Mr. Ross!

Thank you so much for reaching out. Yes, I'd love to meet with you by phone. You can reach me at (408) 446-4920 any day between 8 AM and Noon. I am available other times as well but I would need advanced notice to make sure the deck is cleared, so to speak. I am excited about the possibility of working with a quality operation like Vend.ly and look forward to the opportunity to learn more about the position and tell you a bit about myself as well. Again, thank you for reaching out.

Best Regards,

Koop

Hi Ludovic!
Thanks for reading this email! My name is Koop and you are connected on LinkedIn to my friend Sarah Jacobson. I’m studying Web Development using JavaScript on both the front and back ends, and I saw that you were working at Google. I have been a fan of Google for awhile and I’m really impressed by the work that Google has been doing with JavaScript and the V8 engine. Some time when you are free I’d love to buy you a cup of coffee and pick your brain about your experience as a Web Solutions Engineer and how you use JavaScript. Can I send you a LinkedIn connection request?

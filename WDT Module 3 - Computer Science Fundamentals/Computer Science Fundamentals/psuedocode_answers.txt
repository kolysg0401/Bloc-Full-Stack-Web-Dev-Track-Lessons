Checkpoint 3 - Introduction to Pseudocode

Short Answer
Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Pseudocode is a way to develop algorithms and express what code should do without using a particular language syntax but rather a format meant for humans to read rather than machines.  For "brainstorming before you begin to code your program."

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
Psuedocode is not meant to be executed, it won't compile, transpile, or any other kind of pile. It's meant to be read by humans ands maybe really reeally smart dogs ;)

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT number1 AND number2
FUNCTION compare(number1, number2)
	IF number1 OR number2 are null
		BREAK
		IF number1 > number2
			PRINT number1
		ELSE IF number2 > number1
			PRINT number2
		ELSE 
			PRINT number1 + ' is equal to ' + number2
		END IF
	ELSE CONTINUE
	END IF
END FUNCTION

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
FUNCTION printNumbers
	SET number = 1
	WHILE number < 101
		PRINT number THEN
		SET number = number + 1
	END WHILE
END FUNCTION


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
FUNCTION returnPhoneNumber
	LOAD OBJECT phoneBook
	PROMPT for name
	RETURN phoneBook by name
END FUNCTION


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
function returnPhoneNumber() {
	var phoneBook = {
		Alex: '(520) 379-2658',
		Bob: '(568) 458-7412',
		Carl: '(100) 562-1237',
		Dave: '(888) 777-6666',
		Earl: '(301) 111-2222',
		Frank: '(555) 999-1111',
		George: '(455) 745-2587',
	};
	var name = [prompt('Enter First Name', 'First Name Only')];
	return phoneBook[name];
}

returnPhoneNumber();

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold">WDT - FrontEnd Fundamentals & Programming<br> Module 1 - Becoming a Developer<br>Checkpoint 3 - Working with Agile Teams</p>

**Q1: What are the typical Agile team roles?**
> **A1:**
* Product Manager/Product Owner- strategy, roadmap, and feature definition
* Project Manager - process management, on-time delivery
* Designer - "Look and feel". Mock-ups, wireframes, interactions
* User Researcher - Profile target user and understand their behavior
* Team Lead - technical management, direction, quality
* Developer - technical creation, maintenance, product integrity

**Q2: What parts of the development lifecycle is each role responsible for?**
> **A2:** See above

**Q3: What is a Kanban board?**
> **A3:** A Kanban board is a tool that helps you visualize your work and workflow

**Q4: Why do we use a Kanban board in Agile development?**
> **A4:** To optimize for work flow, deliver maximun results in minimum time

**Q5: Explain velocity, sprint, user story, card, and agile as if you were teaching another student. Give a real-world example for each.**
> **A5:**
> * Velocity: Velocity is the number of points per sprint a development team completes. It is calculated as an average and usually evens out over time as a team learns to estimate and work together.
> * Sprint: Sprints are time-delimited periods of work ranging from one to four weeks. The goal at the end of a sprint, is to deploy a functional piece of the product. A sprint cycle usually includes the following meetings, depending on a team's needs: Prioritization, Estimation, Planning, Review, and Retrospective. The team schedules meetings for Prioritization, Estimation, and Planning all occur before a sprint starts, while Review and Retrospective occur at the end of a sprint. The Project Manager facilitates all meetings as needed by the team.
> * User Story: User Stories are written in the format "As a __ , I want __, so __". User Stories can be written from the perspective of a user, product owner, or developer. Here are some examples: "As a user, I want to see all of my previous orders, so that I can reorder the products I use frequently."
> * Card: Cards represent the smallest unit of work that can provide value to a user. Cards include an estimation, User Story, Tasks, Epic, and any other relevant details
> * Agile: Agile is a product development methodology that relies on the rapid production of high-quality software that aligns with the needs of your userbase. Agile teams practice learning quickly, continuous integration or delivery, and iterative development cycles

**Q6: What are different estimation methods teams can use? Explain pros and cons of each method. Which method would you prefer?**
> **A6:**
> * Planning Poker: Highly accurate, but not so good for big groups or lots of cards
> * Bucket System: Good for lots of people and cards, but not very precise
> * Big/Unc/Small: Very fast, but only good for preliminary sorting
> * TFB/NFC/1(Sprint): Variation of Big/Unc/Small with same pros and cons
> * Dot Voting: Super-simple and effective, but only for small numbers of cards
> * T-shirt Sizes: Not a precise as Poker, but more exact than Big/Unc/Small
> * Affinity Mapping: Great for medium amounts of cards, but a very physical activity
> * Ordering Protocol: Precise but time consuming

**Q7: Explain the difference between tasks, cards, stories, slices, and epics, as if you were teaching another student. Give a real-world example of a development project, and explain the breakdown of pieces into each type.**
> **A7:**
>* Tasks: Tasks include every item that must be done for the card to be complete
>* Cards: Cards represent the smallest unit of work that can provide value to a user. Cards include an estimation, User Story, Tasks, Epic, and any other relevant details
>* Stories: A way to frame the work to be done in the format of, "As a __, I want __ so that _."
>* Slices: A section of an Epic organized by either horizontally (by feature), or vertically (by stack layer).
>* Epics: A project
> For example: The Product Manager, with perhaps the input of the User Researcher, decides we need to implement a new set of features. That starts the *Epic*. The feature set will be too much to accomplish in a single sprint, in fact it make take several sprints and iterations to get everything in place, so the Project Manager, Designer, and Team Lead will decompose the **Epic** into a series of **Stories**, something actionable that delivers a vertical **slice** of functionality to the customer that is valuable and can be accomplished in a single sprint. **Stories** go on **cards** and are themselves further decomposed into **Tasks** by the Developers as parts of the story that detail HOW the story will be completed

**Q8: What format makes a good user story?**
> **A8:** "As a _____ (insert whatever role or presepective you choose, User, Developer, Senior Citizen, Gamer, etc.) I want _____ (insert whatever that role or perspectives leads you to wish for: a new feature added, a feature removed, to be able to do something more simply, a different color skin, etc) so that ____ (insert the percieved benefit based on the role or perspective chosen: The product will be easier to use, more worth spending money on, unharmful to minors more fun, etc.)"

**Q9: What elements should a card include?**
> **A9:** An estimation, User Story, Tasks, Epic, and any other relevant details like Workflow-related dates, Priority, People working on a task.

**Q10: How does an idea go from conception to production?**
> **A10:**
>* (Concept Recognition/Definition, Concept Investigation, Concept Selection, Concept Review)==>
>* (Planning, Preliminary Design, Design Review, Design/Analysis/Review Loop, Detail Design, Analysis, Design Review)==>
>* (Prototyping, Testing/Debugging, Design Review, Release Design for Production)==>
>* (Production!, Marketing, Distribution?)

**Q11: Why do development teams use Kanban boards?**
>* They are are visual,flexible, easy to use, help teams collaborate, increase efficiency and reduce waste

**Q12: What is the purpose of estimation?**
> **A12:** Through group consensus building, arrive at an estimate of the size and complexity of a card realtive to the overall the overall goals for the sprint

**Q13: What is the sprint cycle?**
> **A13:** Sprints are time-delimited periods of work ranging from one to four weeks. The goal at the end of a sprint, is to deploy a functional piece of the product. A sprint cycle usually includes the following meetings, depending on a team's needs: Prioritization, Estimation, Planning, Review, and Retrospective. The team schedules meetings for Prioritization, Estimation, and Planning all occur before a sprint starts, while Review and Retrospective occur at the end of a sprint. The Project Manager facilitates all meetings as needed by the team.

**Q14: What could go wrong when estimating cards? How would you mitigate these risks?**
> **A14:** It sets false expectations, it takes a lot of time, requires absolute honesty and transparency (rare).  To guard against that validate that your estimates are internally consistent among stories as you go along, grill the PO to be clear on what exactly the story entails, create environment where people free free to discuss and disagree before coming to a respectful consensus.

**Q15: Imagine you are looking to lease a new apartment. Write each card that would be in the apartment lease epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?**
>**A15:** Research, Plan, Investigate, Review, Choose

**Q16: Imagine you are creating a nursery for a new baby. Write each card that would be in this epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?**
>**A16:** Research, Plan, Investigate, Review, Choose

**Q17: Imagine you are planning a vacation. Write each card that would be in this epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?**
>**A17: Research, Plan, Investigate, Review, Choose**

**Q18: What is an MVP?**
>**A18:** The minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort." The primary benefit of an MVP is you can gain understanding about your customersâ€™ interest in your product without fully developing the product. The sooner you can find out whether your product will appeal to customers, the less effort and expense you spend on a product that will not succeed in the market.

**Q19: Explain in your own words what a dual-track system is and what advantages it provides.**
>**A19:** The Dual Track Agile method divides the daily activity of a product team into two tracks: discovery and delivery. The two tracks go in parallel. During discovery, the team identifies problems and starts thinking about the solutions, designing prototypes, and testing them as much as possible. Once the prototype is validated, the team can start the delivery of that feature, which means actually building it. The idea is to test as many solutions as possible during discovery, and discard all the wrong ones during this phase so that only the right solutions are developed during delivery. The Discovery track is all about quickly generating validated product backlog items, and the Delivery track is all about generating releasable software.

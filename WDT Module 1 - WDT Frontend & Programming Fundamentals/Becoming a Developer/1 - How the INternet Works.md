> **A1:** Typo alert.  It's Tim Berne**r**s-Lee, with a second 'r' between the 'e' and 's' at the end. What is the best way to pass on typos we see?

> I was expecting at least a mention of something like whatever the present day equivalent of the OSI Model is, at least covering the idea that the information flowing between server and client gets nested liked in different layers like Russian matryoshka dolls to get the right stuff to and from where it needs to go. Last I knew it was down to really 4 or maybe 5 layers from the original 7 as there was some debate on where some layers end and others begin, and I'm sure things have changed since last I was up on networking protocols.  But I trust you guys to teach us what we need to know and maybe we don't need to know that level of detail for Web Development.  As long as the internet works! :-)

**Questions**

**1.** What did you learn in this checkpoint? Did you encounter any issues getting your browser, text editor, or terminal installed? If so, what steps did you take to solve them? Submit this checkpoint with the answers.

> A: I encountered no issues. Windows versions of Chrome browser, Visual Studio Code editor, and Bash on Windows installed. There was not a lot new in this checkpoint for me as I had already spent quite a bit of time researching development environments and what I would need to have installed to move forward as a Windows user. As a Windows user I found this article very helpful [char.gd/blog/2017/how-to-...ment-on-windows]. Putting it together with the instructions here in this checkpoint for Windows users to install git Bash highlights continuing misconceptions about Windows capabilities as a development environment. Opinions that, while perhaps well founded when they were formed under earlier versions of Windows, they are no longer accurate since the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and I would suggest a revision to this checkpoint material to replace the instructions for Windows users to install Git Bash with instructions for enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux [docs.microsoft.com/en-us/...ystem-for-linux] and then installing one of the several flavors of Linux available in the Windows Store: Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, SLES, Kali Linux, Debian GNU/Linux.. I personally am sticking with Ubuntu because that's what is running on the VPS I have set up at DigitalOcean

> Other side note on text editors. I was going through my initial Windows development environment setup I installed Atom along with Visual Studio Code. I can't remember the exact reasons now but at some point I elected to go with Visual Studio Code and uninstalled Atom. Since it is the default text editor refer to hear in the checkpoints I will reinstall it and give it another go, but can you think of any reason why a Windows user would not want to use vs code instead of Atom?

> Revision: I went ahead and reinstalled Atom just to be on the same page as the curriculum

I'm glad you didn't run into any issues. IDE choice usually boils down to personal preference. For now the best reason to stick with atom is as you said, it stays consistent with the curriculum, but you're welcome to use whichever IDE you feel the most comfortable developing with, so practice with both, see which you like best!

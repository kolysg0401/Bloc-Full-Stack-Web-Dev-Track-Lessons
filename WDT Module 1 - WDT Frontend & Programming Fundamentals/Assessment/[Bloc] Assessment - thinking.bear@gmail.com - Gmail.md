2 Name 4 common HTML tags and tell me what they are used for Objectives: Demonstrate an understanding of arrays. Demonstrate an understanding of object literals. You scored a 1 out of 1

3 Assume that I have code that I want to push from my local computer to github. Can you tell me what steps I would take to do that? Objectives: Demonstrate an understanding of when to use the 'init' command Demonstrate an understanding of when to use common git commands You scored a 0.5 out of 0.5

4 When using CSS selectors, what character do we put in front of IDs and what character do we put in front of classes? Objectives: Demonstrate an understanding of when to use the 'add' command Demonstrate an understanding of when to use common git commands You scored a 1 out of 1

5 == vs === Objectives: Demonstrate an understanding of different types of equality Demonstrate an understanding of different built-in data types You scored a 0.5 out of 0.5

6 HTML Questions Objectives: Understand how elements contain other elements Understand what an unordered list is Use html links You scored a 0.5 out of 0.5

7 Functional Scope JS Objectives: Interpret the use of function scope Interpret the use of calling a function Interpret the use of using function arguemnts You scored a 0.5 out of 0.5

8 Two Scopes Objectives: Undersand how to define methods Understand how to return a value from a method Understand how to pass arguments Apply conditional expressions and operators You scored a 1 out of 1

9 Functional JavaScript Again Objectives: Apply the each method to iterate over an array Understand the concept of iteration Demonstrate using a block as an argument You scored a 0 out of 0.5

11. // In Javascript // Write a function that accepts 2 arguments, where both arguments are numbers and returns the sum of those two numbers. // sum(4, 3) => 7 Objectives: Create a function with parameters. Create and manipulate an array. You scored a 1.5 out of 1.5

**12. // Below, we have an array of movie objects // Using Javascript, loop through each object in the array // and console.log the movie title of each movie

var bestMovies = [ { title: 'Star Wars' }, { title: 'Top Gun' }, { title: 'The Notebook' } ]** Objectives: Interpret the creation of an object literal Demonstrate an understanding of manipulation of an object literal You scored a 1 out of 1

13. // In the language of your choice // Write a function that takes 2 arguments - an array of numbers and a number // And returns true if the array contains the number and false otherwise // Example: // foo([2,4,7],7) would return true // foo([2,4,5],7) would return false Objectives: Create a function with parameters Build for loops to efficiently iterate over code Use conditionals to control the flow of your code with if statements Create and manipulate an array You scored a 1.5 out of 1.5"

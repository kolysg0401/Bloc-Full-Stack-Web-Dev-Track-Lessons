I was feeling pretty good until the drop down menus for this submission appeared

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "CHECKPOINT WORK" AND "ASSIGNMENT WORK"?

Which Commit do you want?

Why would I not merge to master, no instructions to make another fork

This was a good exercise from the stand point of seeing all that is involved in using git from the CLI, but I am still having trouble with commits and merges. Why did we merge the folder we deleted everything from back into master? What exactly is going on when we use checkout? I have been struggling with Git and while I do think I understand it a little bit more than I did I'm still pretty lost on how to actually use it in the wild let alone without a reference available

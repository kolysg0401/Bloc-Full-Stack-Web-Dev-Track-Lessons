## Exercises

Rate yourself on these skills and reflect on where you are strong and where you are weak. What will you commit to improving? Include this information in your checkpoint submission.

1. **Interpersonal Communication**
> 8/10 here. I can be a "fast talker" in that I speak my words too quickly sometimes in an effort to get all my thoughts out, but I've worked on it all my life so it's managable.  My written communication skills are good, on the phone as well where I am not a fast talker for some reason. Building rapport is easy for me. I can usually get a good read on people and adapt to their style so I can talk to almost anybody about almost anything. People more often than not find me personable, a good teammate, and witty conversationalist.
2. **Accountability**
> 10/10 Personal Responsibility is huge deal to me. I do what I say I am going to do. I am always on time. Deliverables on schedule or before, and if somehow there a problem comes up I document that issue and be extra honest, transparent, and upfront with client/stakeholder/manager **as soon as I know**
3. **Technical Skills**
> 5/10  This is why I am here.  **My greatest commitmnent right now** is learning to walk the talk and I am spending ~10 hours a day on becoming a proficient coder
4. **Technical Communication**
> 7/10 I need some more practice at this but I have had positive experiences so far and seem to do it well because I have a gift for vocabulary which helps a lot
5. **Confidence**
> 5/10  Perhaps even more than the Technical Skills I also rated 5, this is where I need the most work and commit to work tyhe hardest.  Hopefully that confidence will come with the skills, but I will also need to tap into it to become a successful networker
6. **Resilience and Grit**
> 10/10 I am older any other Bloc students I have met so far (51 in May), so I have been around a bit, already changed careers once, and have a bit more perspective on myself than some others might. I have worn many hats in my life and coding has always been hanging out on the periphery since I took my first programming class in Junior High somewhere around 1979 learning BASIC on a Commodore PET with monochrome green screen and a cassette tape drives.  I dabbled for years and years as a hobby, a weekend here, a night there, but I never followed the call to code the way I should have, I always had a reason to choose another direction when things got hard or inconvenient.  But at this point in my life I know what I am supposed to be doing, and the way I have lost myself in what I have been doing since starting Bloc is my proof to myself I am finally on the right path, finally doing what I am supposed to be doing, it is part of who I am, and I will never stop.  Even if I end up living in a van down by the river I will find a way to keep coding!

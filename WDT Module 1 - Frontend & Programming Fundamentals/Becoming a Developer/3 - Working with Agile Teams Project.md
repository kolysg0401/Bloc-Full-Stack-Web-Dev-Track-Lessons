>Oops!  Can't believe I forgot to include this!  And yes, you weren't kidding about completing this checkpoint feeling like an olympic feat! This could easily be 2 or 3 checkpoints based on the detail of the questions. It's enough to make me anti-Agile!  Well maybe not quite, but hopefully I understood correctly what I needed to do here for the project?

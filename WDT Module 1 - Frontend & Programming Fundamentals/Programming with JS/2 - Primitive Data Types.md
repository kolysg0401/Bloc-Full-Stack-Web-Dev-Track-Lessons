**Checkpoint Two - Primitive Data Types**</p>

**_Questions_**
> ** Q1: What are JavaScript's three primitive data types?**

**A1:** This is a bit confusing because there are five (5) primitive data types in javascript. For which three is Bloc looking?  I will assume the three that were highlighted above as "A few" of javascript's data types and are not refering to `null` or `undefined`. The three main, most common javascript data types are `string` (a sequence of characters), `number` (a numerical value either integer or floating point), and `boolean`(a binary data type that can only have the value of true or false). I get it, `null` and `undefined` are not as usefull and can''t be manipulated like `string`, `number`, or `Boolean` but the premise of the question is confusing

> **Q2: What are the only two values available to the Boolean data type?**

**A2:**  `boolean` can only be true or false

> **Q3: If you create a variable but don't set a value, what data type is the does the variable hold?**

**A3:** `undefined`

> **Q4: If you wanted to convert a Number to a String, how would you do that in JavaScript?**

**A4:** Use the built-in `toString()` method

> **Q5: What built-in function/method would you use to determine the length of a given String?**

**A5:** `.length()`

** Code Practice**

```
var myName="Koop";

console.log(myName.charAt(0));
```

Model
The Model consists of the data structures needed to store information and the methods used to interface with the data layer of the application.

View
The View controls everything a user sees and is handled by a view engine which takes dynamic content, replaces that content with placeholders inside of an HTML file, and then sends the final HTML to the client.

Controller
The Controller handles incoming requests from the client. It will interact with the model to move data in and out of the database and the view.
